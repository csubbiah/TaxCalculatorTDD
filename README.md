TestDrivenDevelopment

## Guidance:
* After reading Part I  of Test-Driven Development 3- 4 times, i get a lot of takeaways - from user story come up with ToDo list and then write empty test,
* then fill it with constants and replace with variables, later think about flyweight factory
* and then think about simplicity of a class rather than making the class complex.
* We measure what we have done
* Start exploring implementing interface at core class, then move this responsibility to another class and get that invoked from the core class - implicitly we start building Solid Principles from TDD & we measure our outcome.
* After this reading, i felt i require to try this out on my own but still in a correct manner to think the requirement small (Xtreme Programming), so referred an example as mentioned in the reference section
